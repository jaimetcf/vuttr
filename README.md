Small App - Code Challenge

### Short description
This is a small app specified as a code challange for BossaBox contracting process.
It allows allows the user to create and update a list of tools.

### Technical stack
The app uses the MERN stack:
- frontend: React.js
- backend: Node.js, Espress, and MongoDB (through mongoose)

The database is hosted on a cloud cluster in Atlas [here](https://www.mongodb.com/)

### How to install the app
The App is deployed on firebase (frontend) and Heroku (backend), and uses the [MongoDB Cloud Database, Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).

So, you do not need to install it in your machine.
Nevertheless, if you want to download the code, and run it on your machine, or use it as a starting point for another app, just:

1. Clone the full /jaimetcf/face-ai.git repo
2. In the backend folder, type:
```
   npm install
```
This will install all the dependencies needed for running the backend.

3. Also, in the frontend folder, type:
```
   npm install
```
This will install all the dependencies needed for running the frontend.


### How to run the app
4. In the backend folder, type:
```
   npm start
```
The server will connect to the database in the remote Atlas Cluster, what may take some seconds.
When you see the message: 
```
Listening on port 4000!
```
that means the webserver is ready to receive and process the http API calls 
comming from the frontend.


5. In the frontend folder, type:
```
   npm start
```
This will be enough to start the react.js development server, and open a new tab in your 
web browser where the app user interface will appear. 
This may take some time also.

6. Have fun!
